//Move Zeroes
/*
First Pass:
The first loop iterates over the array and whenever a non-zero element is found, it is moved to the k index.
k is then incremented to point to the next position for a potential non-zero element.

Second Pass:
After all non-zero elements have been moved to the front, the second loop fills the remaining positions in the array with zeros, starting from the k index.
